# MongoDB Fundamentals Assignment – Week 1

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions for the MongoDB Fundamentals Week 1 assignment. The tasks cover:

- MongoDB setup  
- CRUD operations  
- Advanced queries with filters, projections, and sorting  
- Aggregation pipelines  
- Indexing for performance optimization  

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)  
- **MongoDB** (either locally or using MongoDB Atlas)  
- **MongoDB Shell** (`mongosh`) or **MongoDB Compass**

---

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-github-classroom-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>

### 3. Install MongoDB (Choose one)

#### Option A: Local Installation

- Download and install MongoDB from the [official website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
- Start MongoDB locally using:

### ❌ Incorrect Example (not inside Markdown):

When pasting content without backticks (`) for code blocks or without the proper Markdown formatting (like `#`, `-`, or `[Link](url)`), it renders as plain text — which is what you're experiencing.

---

### ✅ Fix

To make sure everything stays **inside the Markdown**, use triple backticks (```) for blocks of code and list formatting (`-` or `1.`) for instructions.

If you're pasting it into `README.md`, **use a Markdown-capable editor** like:

- VS Code
- GitHub web editor
- Obsidian
- StackEdit

If you're still seeing it break after pasting into your GitHub repository, **ensure the file is named exactly `README.md` (case-sensitive)** and is rendered on GitHub or any Markdown-compatible viewer.

Would you like me to give you the entire corrected version again in a plain copy-paste block?
